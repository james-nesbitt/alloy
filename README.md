# Alloy

Alloy is a multi-user, micro-kernel styled application platform written in Go. It features a modular backend kernel and utilizes **WIT-based WASM plugins** for its functionality (WebAssembly Component Model).

## 🚀 Quick Start

To build the entire project (Core, Plugins, GUIs, CLI):

```bash
# 1. Install prerequisites (Go 1.25+, TinyGo 0.33+, wit-bindgen-cli, just)
# 2. Build everything
just all
```

The primary entry point is the `alloy` tool:

```bash
# Start a standalone core
./build/bin/alloy core --listen unix://./alloy.sock

# Start TUI with a dedicated core instance
./build/bin/alloy tui --dedicated

# Connect TUI to an existing backend
./build/bin/alloy tui --socket unix://./alloy.sock
```

The resulting binaries will be placed in the `./build/` directory:
- `./build/bin/alloy`: Unified CLI entry point
- `./build/bin/alloy-core`: Main backend kernel
- `./build/bin/alloy-tui`: Terminal user interface
- `./build/bin/alloy-gui`: Native graphical user interface
- `./build/wasm/*.wasm`: Compiled application plugins

## 🛠️ Build and Development

Alloy uses a `justfile` for orchestration. Key commands include:

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `just all` | Build both the Core and all Plugins |
| `just build-core` | Build the Go backend binary |
| `just build-plugins` | Build all WASM-based plugins |
| `just setup-dev` | Configure Go workspace and replacements |
| `just test` | Run the complete test suite |
